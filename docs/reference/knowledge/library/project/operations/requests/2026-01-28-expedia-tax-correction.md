# Request for Tax Configuration Correction

**To:** Expedia Partner Central Tax Team
**Subject:** Correction of Tax Rates for Villa Thaifa (ID: 114807934) - Marrakech

Dear Tax Team,

We are currently setting up our property, **Villa Thaifa (Hotel ID: 114807934)**, located in Marrakech, Morocco.

We noticed that the default tax configuration suggested by the system (Total ~8 MAD) does not match the official local tax rates applicable to our specific category of establishment (Maison d'Hôtes / Tourist Establishment).

**Correct Tax Rate Required:**

- **Total Local Tax**: 30.00 MAD per person, per night.
- **Composition**: This amount covers the "Taxe de séjour sur les établissements touristiques" (Tourist Stay Tax) and related municipal fees.

**Evidence:**
We have an official "Statement of Payment" (Bayan Al-Ada) from the local authorities confirming this rate of 30.00 MAD.

**Action Requested:**
Please update our property's tax settings to collect **30.00 MAD per person per night** representing the total local/municipal taxes. These taxes should be set as "Payable at property" (collected from guests), which is the standard practice here.

Thank you for your assistance in ensuring our compliance with local regulations.

Best regards,

**Omar El Mountassir**
*On behalf of Villa Thaifa*
