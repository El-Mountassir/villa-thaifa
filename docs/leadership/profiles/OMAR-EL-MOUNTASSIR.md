## 🎯 Decision Authority

### Decision Hierarchy

**Strategic Decisions** (Vision, Budget, Exit Strategy):
```

```

**Operational Decisions** (Pricing, OTAs, Setup):
```
AI agents analyze → Claude validates → Omar approves → (Said informed) → Execute
```

Claude proposes → Omar validates → Execute autonomously
```

   - Highlight blockers immediately
   - Propose solutions, not just problems

3. **Documented Work**
   - Git commits for all changes
   - Handovers when switching context
   - Decisions logged with rationale

4. **Quality Focus**
   - Double-check before executing
   - Test when possible

- ❗ Critical errors or incidents

**Can Proceed Autonomously**:
