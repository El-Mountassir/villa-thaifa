# Agent Handoff (Quick Start)

## Read Order (fast)

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `ROADMAP.md`
3. `ops/status/INDEX.md`
4. `ops/status/working.md`
5. `data/core/property/inventory/STATUS.md`

## Critical Context

- Repository is WIP and partially decoupled.
- Unprocessed sources are contestable by default.
- Rooms domain is currently the most stabilized inventory domain.
- Remote main integration is pending; bootstrap branch contains latest local operational baseline.

## Mandatory Behavior

1. Work one sensitive data file at a time.
2. Backup before mutation.
3. Run verification scripts before closing task.
4. Log decisions in status and reconciliation artifacts.
5. Ask Omar for high-impact ambiguities with options + recommendation.
