# Next 7 Days Execution Plan (v1)

## Objective (This Week)

Deliver a stable, auditable canonical data foundation across the highest-priority domains, while keeping scope minimal and deletion-safe.

## Week Scope

Priority domains:

1. Rooms (finish fully)
2. Amenities
3. Facilities

## Day-by-Day Plan

## Day 1 — Rooms Finalization

### Goals

- Complete consolidation from remaining room legacy files into canonical `rooms.md`
- Run strict unique-information gate per legacy file
- Delete only files that are proven redundant and safe

### Tasks

1. Verify current room canonical structure and metadata integrity
2. Verify unique-information status for `rooms-2.md`, `rooms-3.md`, `rooms-4.md`
3. Apply missing migration fields (if any)
4. Update `rooms-reconciliation-log.md` with explicit deletion decisions
5. Delete only files passing gate

### Done Criteria

- `rooms.md` has complete data contract + profiles
- Deletion decisions are evidence-backed in log
- No unresolved unique-info gap for deleted files

## Day 2 — Rooms Hardening + Validation Script Skeleton

Template usage for this week:
- Use `docs/project/templates/canonical-domain-template.md` when opening a new canonical domain
- Use `docs/project/templates/reconciliation-entry-template.md` for each reconciliation step
- Use `docs/project/templates/deletion-safety-report-template.md` before deleting any legacy file
- Use `docs/project/templates/weekly-summary-template.md` for Friday freeze report

### Goals

- Stabilize rooms schema for v1
- Introduce script scaffolding for repeatable verification
- Introduce Jinja2 rendering path for repeatable document generation

### Tasks

1. Freeze required columns for rooms v1
2. Create `scripts/` folder with uv-based validators:
   - `validate_contracts.py`
   - `check_unique_info.py`
   - `domain_verify.py`
3. Run `uv sync` and verify scripts execute via `uv run`
4. Add basic checks for:
   - row count
   - required columns
   - duplicate IDs
5. Add one run command (example: `make verify-rooms`)
6. Add Jinja2 template rendering script scaffold (for planned auto-generation)

### Done Criteria

- Rooms checks can run reproducibly
- Results are understandable without manual parsing

## Day 3 — Amenities Canonicalization

### Goals

- Establish canonical amenities file with contract and reconciliation workflow

### Tasks

1. Inventory amenities source files
2. Define canonical column set (KISS)
3. Migrate unique data into canonical file
4. Create amenities reconciliation log
5. Run deletion safety checks on amenities legacy files

### Done Criteria

- Amenities has SSOT + contract + log
- First deletion decisions are documented

## Day 4 — Facilities Canonicalization

### Goals

- Repeat the same pipeline for facilities

### Tasks

1. Source inventory and uniqueness map
2. Canonical schema definition
3. Consolidation into canonical markdown
4. Reconciliation log updates
5. Deletion safety gates

### Done Criteria

- Facilities has SSOT + contract + log
- Safe retention/deletion status is explicit

## Day 5 — Cross-Domain Consistency Pass

### Goals

- Ensure naming, enum style, and confidence/status fields are consistent across Rooms/Amenities/Facilities

### Tasks

1. Normalize shared fields (IDs, status values, confidence labels)
2. Align formatting rules (multi-values, defaults, language policy)
3. Resolve cross-file reference mismatches

### Done Criteria

- Shared conventions are consistent across 3 domains
- No unresolved cross-domain naming collisions

## Day 6 — Verification Automation Upgrade

### Testing Commands

```bash
make test
uv run pytest tests/test_scripts.py
```

### Goals

- Move from manual checks to deterministic multi-domain verification

### Tasks

1. Expand scripts to support all 3 domains
2. Add summary report output (markdown or console table)
3. Ensure every deletion gate can be script-assisted

### Done Criteria

- One command provides multi-domain health status
- Reconciliation evidence can be generated quickly

## Day 7 — Weekly Freeze + Next Sprint Setup

### Goals

- Freeze what is stable
- Prepare backlog for next week (pricing and reservation mapping)

### Tasks

1. Generate weekly summary:
   - domains completed
   - files deleted safely
   - files retained with reasons
2. List unresolved `owner_pending` items for Said/Omar confirmation
3. Create next week backlog items for:
   - Pricing rules
   - Reservation mapping

### Done Criteria

- Weekly state is clear and auditable
- Next sprint starts with low ambiguity

## Daily Non-Negotiables

1. Backup before mutation (`cp file file.backup-YYYY-MM-DD`)
2. One-file-at-a-time changes
3. No deletion without strict unique-info gate
4. Reconciliation log update in the same working session

## Lightweight KPIs (Weekly)

- Canonical domains completed
- Legacy files safely retired
- Validation pass rate
- Open `owner_pending` count

## Out of Scope This Week

- Full app implementation
- Database migration as SSOT
- Complex backend architecture
