# docs/content — Content Isolation Map

This folder is split by processing state to keep active work separate from contestable assets.

## Folders

- `docs/content/active/`: content currently approved for active operational use.
- `docs/content/reference/`: historical/raw content and media retained as reference input.
- `docs/content/pending/`: newly ingested content waiting for triage.

## Current State

- Existing room/facility media and source markdown were moved to `docs/content/reference/`.
- `active` and `pending` are intentionally empty until explicit promotion/triage.
