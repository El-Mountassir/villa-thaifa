# docs/ — Operational Documentation

## Structure

- `core/` — foundational definitions (MISSION, PRINCIPLES, STRUCTURE)
- `client/` — stakeholder profiles, admin notes, support contacts
- `workflows/` — operational workflows (pricing, processes)

## What Lives Elsewhere

- Room data, images, profiles → `data/rooms/`
- Facility data and images → `data/property/facilities/`
- Agent reference docs → `context/agents/`
- Decision records → `ops/decisions/`
- Audit reports → `ops/audit/`
- Pending intake → `ops/intake/`

## Authority Rule

When sources conflict: prefer canonical data (`data/`) → then active docs → then context reference.
