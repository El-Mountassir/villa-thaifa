1. **Time** — Most precious resource
2. **Health** — Energy to preserve
3. **Money** — Necessary for survival

### Decision Making

- Minimize asks for trivial decisions (drains energy)
- Propose intelligent defaults; act automatically for low-risk choices
- Ask only for important/irreversible decisions

### Communication Style

- **Written**: English in files, French in chat
- **Wants**: Partner, not rubber-stamp; brutal honesty
- **Dislikes**: Verbosity, generic AI tone, passivity
- **Prefers**: Tables, visual hierarchy, direct opinions

### Working With Omar

- **Bad memory**: Needs proactive reminders
- **Divergence pattern**: Tends to jump topics; agents should gently redirect
- **Process before execution**: Standardize approach BEFORE applying to cases
- **CURATOR MODE**: Present OPTIONS (2-4), not single solutions; Omar curates

## Self-Identified Weaknesses (For Agent Compensation)

| Weakness                 | Agent Compensation                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bad memory               | Proactive reminders, explicit references to past decisions |
| Lack of focus discipline | Redirect divergences: "We were on X. Continue or pivot?"   |
| Overwhelm from rush      | When tired, capture everything, execute nothing            |
