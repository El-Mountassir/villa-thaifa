# Expedia Amenities: Gap Analysis & specific Actions

> **Purpose**: Ensure critical "Luxury" assets (Infinity Pool, Hammam) are correctly captured despite form limitations.
> **Comparison**: `amenities_recommendation.md` (Ideal) vs. `Expedia Form` (Actual Options).

## 🚨 Critical Gaps & Mappings

The standard Expedia form provided does **not** have explicit checkboxes for some of Villa Thaifa's key differentiators. You must handle these carefully to ensure they appear correctly to guests.

### 1. The "Infinity Pool" Issue

* **Gap**: The form lists `Outdoor pool`, `Swim-up bar`, `Waterslide`, etc., but **no specific checkbox for "Infinity Pool"** in the main list.
* **Action**:
    1. Check **"Outdoor pool (open all year)"**.
    2. Check **"Pool sun loungers"** and **"Pool umbrellas"**.
    3. **Crucial**: Go to the **"Additional Amenities"** section (at the bottom) or **"Unique Amenities"**.
    4. Manually search/add **"Infinity Pool"** if the search bar allows, or ensure it is prominent in the **Photo Captions** and **Property Description** later.
  * *Risk*: If not explicitly tagged, you lose the "Infinity Pool" filter visibility.

### 2. The "Hammam" Mapping

* **Gap**: The form lists `Steam room`, `Sauna`, `Hot tub`, but often misses the specific term **"Hammam"** or "Turkish Bath" in the main checkboxes.
* **Action**:
    1. Under **Spa Services**, check **"Full-service spa"**.
    2. Check **"Steam room"** (This is the closest technical equivalent).
    3. Check **"Masages"**.
    4. Like the pool, use **"Unique Amenities"** to explicitly add **"Traditional Hammam"** if possible.

### 3. Solarium

* **Gap**: No checkbox for "Solarium".
* **Action**: Check **"Rooftop terrace"** (this is often more valuable for SEO) and **"Terrace"**.

### 4. Breakfast Pricing

* **Observation**: You confirmed "Full breakfast", "Local cuisine", "Buffet".
* **Action**: Ensure you strictly select **"Surcharge"** (since it's ~160 MAD) unless you plan to create a specific "Bed & Breakfast" rate plan later. Do **not** check "Free" by mistake, as this causes major guest satisfaction issues.

## ✅ Validated Matches (Good to Go)

These luxury indicators exist in the form and should be checked:

* [x] **24-hour front desk** (Use "Open 24 hours" checkbox).
* [x] **Soundproofed rooms** (Available in "Room conveniences").
* [x] **Turndown service** (Available in "Room conveniences").
* [x] **Concierge services** (Available in "Guest services").
* [x] **Express check-out**.

## Summary of Corrective Actions

1. **Manual Entry**: Type "Infinity Pool" in the "Unique / Add amenities" search bar.
2. **Mapping**: Treat "Steam room" = "Hammam".
3. **Languages**: Ensure **Dutch**, **French**, **English**, **Arabic** are all selected (The form text confirmed they are available).

This analysis ensures that your standard form entry (Step 4) fully reflects the high-end nature of the Villa.
