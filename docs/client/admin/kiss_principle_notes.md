# KISS Principle

The **KISS principle** (**Keep It Simple, Stupid**) is a design and problem-solving philosophy asserting that ==systems work best when they are kept simple rather than made complex==. Coined by aeronautical engineer [Kelly Johnson](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/keep-it-simple-stupid) at Lockheed, it was originally intended to ensure that military aircraft could be repaired in the field with basic tools. 

To apply the KISS principle effectively, follow these strategies across different domains:

1. Software Development & Coding

- **Break Problems Down:** Decompose large, complex problems into smaller, independent subtasks.
- **One Job per Function:** Ensure every function or method has a [single responsibility](https://medium.com/@snrtbnc/the-kiss-principle-in-software-development-4f3045011eb9) to make code easier to test and debug.
- **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Resist adding features or "just in case" abstractions until they are actually needed.
- **Prioritize Readability:** Write code for humans, not machines. Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions.
- **Reuse, Don't Reinvent:** Use built-in libraries and established [coding standards](https://medium.com/@hashila-abeywardana1/the-kiss-principle-in-software-development-88b83be48046) rather than building custom solutions from scratch. 

2. User Experience (UX) & Design

- **Minimize Features:** Focus on the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and only add features that solve the core user problem.
- **Reduce Visual Clutter:** Remove unnecessary icons, buttons, and "noise" that can distract users from their primary goal.
- **Streamline Navigation:** Limit user pathways and use progressive disclosure to reveal complex options only when necessary.
- **Clear Language:** Avoid technical jargon and use simple, active voice in all microcopy and labels. 

3. Business & Communication

- **Direct Presentations:** Keep messages simple and focused on a technical North Star to ensure stakeholders understand the value proposition.
- **Optimize Workflows:** Identify and remove redundant steps in business processes to [improve efficiency](https://helio.app/ux-research/laws-of-ux/kiss/) and reduce costs.
- **Strategic Focus:** Focus on one main objective at a time to prevent a "Jack of all trades" product failure. 

4. Personal Life & Goals

- **Simplify Routines:** Declutter physical and mental spaces to reduce stress and improve focus.
- **Manageable Steps:** Break down large life goals into [attainable daily habits](https://medium.com/grow-yourself-grow-your-business/find-the-next-steps-using-the-kiss-principle-to-achieve-continuous-improvement-7f348e073d2d) to avoid overthinking and paralysis.
