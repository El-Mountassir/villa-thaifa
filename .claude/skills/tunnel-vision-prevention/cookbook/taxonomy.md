## The Eight Symptoms

| Symptom            | Description                    | Counter            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| No rearview mirror | Forward without reviewing past | REARVIEW           |
| No zoom out        | Specific without general       | ZOOM OUT           |
| Tunnel response    | Immediate without context      | CONTEXT FIRST      |
| Blind creation     | New without checking existing  | CHECK BEFORE ACT   |
| Rush forward       | Action without reflection      | PAUSE              |
| Hub ignored        | Options without Linear scan    | HUB SCAN           |
| Invisible progress | Create without tracking        | TRACK PROGRESS     |
| Lost preferences   | Work without preference check  | PREFERENCE CAPTURE |

## Counter-Measure Definitions

### REARVIEW

Review what came before this moment. What was the previous context? What decisions led here?

### ZOOM OUT

Step back from the immediate request. What's the broader goal? What's the pattern, not just the instance?

### CONTEXT FIRST

Before responding, load context. Don't assume — verify.

### CHECK BEFORE ACT

Before creating anything new, search for existing work. Don't duplicate.

### PAUSE

Stop the forward momentum. Reflect before action.

### HUB SCAN

Check Linear for relevant context. The Hub knows what's in progress.

### TRACK PROGRESS

Ensure all work is visible and tracked. Shadow work is forbidden.

### PREFERENCE CAPTURE

Has Omar expressed preferences? Are we aligned?

## Risk Levels

| Context            | Risk Level | Rigor Required               |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Quick question     | Low        | Light check (mental)         |
| Task execution     | Medium     | Standard protocol            |
| New creation       | High       | Full checklist               |
| Strategic decision | Critical   | Maximum rigor + verification |

## Integration Points

### With Session Management

- At session start: ALWAYS run REARVIEW check
- Reference: Any previous context, plan files, recent journal entries

### With Linear

- Before proposing options: Scan relevant projects/issues
- After decisions: Ensure tracked

### With Scope Review

- If tunnel vision detected: Consider `/scope-review` first
- Integration: Scope review addresses "what's missing"

### With Decision Framework

- Tunnel vision check happens BEFORE decision pipeline
- Ensures decisions are based on complete context
