# 🚀 Next Steps: Journey to 20/20 Excellence

> **Status**: Verified "Functional Skeleton" (Rated 2/20).
> **Goal**: Achieve "Luxury Product" (Rated 20/20).
> **Focus**: Aesthetics, Interactivity, Conversion, and Content.

## 1. 🎨 UX/UI Excellence (The "Wow" Factor)

The current site is "clean" but lacks "soul".

- [ ] **Interactive Image Gallery**:
  - Replace placeholder gray boxes with a swipeable, full-screen gallery (Swiper.js or Embla Carousel).
  - _Why_: Guests buy with their eyes.
- [ ] **Mobile Experience**:
  - Replace standard links with a "Hamburger Overlay" menu.
  - Ensure sticky "Book Now" bar on mobile scroll.
- [ ] **Micro-Animations**:
  - Fade-in elements on scroll (Framer Motion).
  - Hover effects on cards (Scale up, shadow deepen).
- [ ] **Typography Refinement**:
  - Verify _Playfair Display_ loading.
  - Adjust line-heights and kerning for "Editorial" look.

## 2. 💰 Integration & Conversion (The Business)

The buttons currently do nothing.

- [ ] **Booking Engine Connectivity**:
  - Link "Check Availability" to the actual HotelRunner Booking Engine URL.
  - _Or_ Build a custom form that emails Said directly.
- [ ] **Contact & Inquiry Form**:
  - Create `/contact` page.
  - Implement "WhatsApp" floating button for instant concierge chat.

## 3. 📝 Content Enrichment

"Lorem Ipsum" or "TBD" kills trust.

- [ ] **Real Photography**:
  - Locate and upload high-res images for _every_ room.
  - Optimize (WebP) for speed.
- [ ] **Bilingual Support (FR/EN)**:
  - Implement standardized i18n (Next-Intl).
  - Ensure French copy is poetic (Luxury), English is precise.

## 4. 🛠️ Infrastructure & Deployment

Localhost is not a product.

- [ ] **Deployment**:
  - Deploy to Vercel (Production URL).
  - Connect domain (`villathaifa.com`).
- **Analytics**:
  - Install Vercel Analytics / Speed Speed.

## 5. 🧹 Immediate "Quick Wins" (Next Session)

1.  **Fix Hero Image**: Use a real, stunning photo instead of a solid color block.
2.  **Add "Amenities" Icons**: Replace text lists with visual icons (Wifi, Pool, AC).
3.  **Footer**: Add a luxury footer with address, social links, and legal.
