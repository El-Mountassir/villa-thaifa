## House Rules

| Rule               | Details                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Check-in**       | From 14:00 to 00:00                                           |
| **Check-out**      | From 11:00 to 00:00                                           |
| **Minimum age**    | 18 years                                                      |
| **Children**       | All ages welcome; 18+ charged as adults                       |
| **Pets**           | Not allowed                                                   |
| **Quiet hours**    | 00:00 - 06:00 (midnight to 6 AM)                              |
| **Smoking**        | Smoking is not allowed (designated smoking area in amenities) |
| **Identification** | Photo ID + credit card required upon arrival                  |
| **Groups**         | 10+ rooms = different policies apply                          |

> **Note (2026-02-21)**: Smoking policy now reads "Smoking is not allowed" in house rules, BUT "Designated smoking area" still appears in amenities. This likely means a designated outdoor area exists but smoking is prohibited indoors. WHERE = still NEEDS_SAID (item PO5).

> **Note (2026-02-21)**: Children threshold changed from "13+ charged as adults" (Dec 2025) to "18+ charged as adults" (current page). This aligns with Children & Occupancy Policy section. The Dec 2025 data likely reflected the extranet config (13–17 = 100% adult rate). Verify with Said.
