# Review the room name

## Room name travelers will see

Based on your selections from previous steps, we created this name using details travelers find important. This makes it easier for them to compare rooms and to know what to expect when booking.

This is what travelers will see

## Apartment

## A quick note about room names

We recommend a standard room name for a few different reasons:

- It’s created based off of information you gave us

- It’s consistent across the site which makes it easier for travelers to find and compare rooms

- It’s translated into different languages which makes it easier to understand for international travelers

If you’d like a custom room name, you can contact us after your listing is live and request one.
